# Angel Game update

originated from J. Conway's [Angel Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_problem) when k=1 and the board is not infinite

some improvements on [code by sschott20](https://github.com/sschott20/Two_agent_Q)

- added angel's detection of adjacent grid to avoid directly stepping into a block by the devil
